## Introduction
This repo is for practice Python projects from 100 Days of Python Code by Angela Yu. The importance of learning coding is to practice, take note, and practice again. Even though I have been through most of the projects in this course; however, I still cannot remember them after a while. Therefore, I decide to go through them again, also put them up into this GitHub repo with more notes about the importances of each projects and what I learn / like / or believe they are important.

The repo will have sub-folder for each project. In each folder, there will be a folder for the starting files for the project, the completed-code folder and also the folder with exe file from the python code.
